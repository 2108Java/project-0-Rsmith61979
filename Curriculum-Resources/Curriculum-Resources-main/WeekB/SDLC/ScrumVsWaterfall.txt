Different ways to implement the SDLC: 

Waterfall: 
	Most basic SDLC. 
	Very linear, one step at a time. 
	top to bottom. 

	In a waterfall SDLC, we do all the requirements in one go. 
	We do all the planning in one go. 
	We do all the desgning in one go. 
	We do all teh building in one go. 
	...
	....
	
	Downsides: 
		Not efficient, we can waste a lot of time if requirements 
		change or fatal errors occur. 

	Advantages: 
		Simple



Scrum: 
	Sprint: 
		Short period of time that is fixed(A month), a project will have multiple 
		sprints. During a sprint we do all of the SDLC steps and the benefit is 
		that we get feedback more continously and more often. 
		Spring planning:
			Planning on what do for the sprint
		Sprint retrospetive: 
			Identifiying any issues or what went well with last weeks sprint. 
		

	Scrum master: 
		Responsible for leading the daily scrum and ensuring every member of
		the team has tasks. 
	Daily scrum:
		Daily short meeting (typically 10-15 min). Each member must communicate, 
		what they have done, what they will do and any blockers they're having. 
	

"Scrumban":
	We use a kanban board on top of scrum.
